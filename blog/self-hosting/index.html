      <h1>My experience self hosting</h1>

      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Jon. This is my first proper blog post. I am
        interested in technology, transit, photography, cities, and video games.
        Today, I will be writing about self hosting.
      </p>

      <h2>What is self hosting?</h2>
      <p>From Wikipedia:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or
          service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside
          of the administrator's own control.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This means, you are running a piece of software on your own computer and
        that software is providing a website or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some common self hosted software includes photo backup services, VPNs,
        password managers, ad blockers, media libraries, and file servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a lot of free, high-quality software created and maintained by
        the open source community. Sometimes, these software are better than
        typical services provided by Google, Microsoft, Apple, and other
        companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        See
        <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted"
          >https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted</a
        >
        and <a href="https://selfh.st/apps/">https://selfh.st/apps/</a> for a
        list of software.
      </p>
      <h2>Why should you self host?</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is one of the biggest reasons why people self host. When you use
        a Google or Apple service, you are relying on trust to protect your
        data. You trust the company's reputation, privacy policy, and engineers
        to store your data safely and use it properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you self host an open source project, you trust the contributors,
        security audits, and yourself. There are always privacy and security
        risks involved when using any online service, but self hosting allows
        you to control some of those risks. You can choose whether to host on
        LAN or the internet. Choosing the latter adds significant risks, and
        using an insecurely hosted application can be worse than using an
        application hosted by Google. You should proceed with caution.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Note: when you self host an open source project, you can always look
          at the codebase to ensure privacy and security, but you should
          consider two things. You need to be a security expert, and you must
          <em>actually</em> read the entire codebase...
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Cost is another reason why people self host. When you use an online
        service, you are paying with your data or a monthly subscription ranging
        from a few dollars to $15 per service. These subscriptions add up
        quickly and,
        <a
          href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2025/08/07/q2-2025-digital-subscription-tracking-report/"
          >according to DCN</a
        >, average total monthly household spending on digital subscriptions is
        $149.64 in Q2 2025. When you self host, you can either pay for a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a>
        (starting at $5 per month) or buy/use an existing computer and pay
        electricity and internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using an old computer is a great way to get started with self hosting.
        My first home server was an old
        <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/dell-inspiron-23-2350"
          >Dell All-in-one</a
        >
        which used a mobile processor. There is no need for powerful systems to
        self host.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, self hosting is a great way to learn and become familiar with
        sysadmin, networking, and Linux CLI.
      </p>
      <h2>What should you self host?</h2>
      <p>
        There are many pieces of software which can be self hosted. Here is a
        list of essential and fun applications to host.
      </p>
      <h3>File server</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first things I self hosted was a file server. File servers
        allow you to access files on a storage drive connected to your server
        from anywhere on your network. For example, you can upload photos to the
        file server from your phone and access it on your laptop without using
        any storage on your devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba"
          >Samba</a
        >
        is an older file server software that is simple and works well with
        Windows. However, it lacks a web UI and other features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://owncloud.com/">ownCloud</a>,
        <a href="https://nextcloud.com/home-users/">Nextcloud</a>,
        <a href="https://manual.seafile.com/">Seafile</a> and
        <a href="https://filebrowser.org/">File Browser</a> are newer file
        server software. In my experience, these applications provide more
        features than I need. I have tested a few of these applications but not
        all of them. I would recommend seeing what makes sense for your use
        case.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Note: File Browser is in "maintenance-only mode"; meaning that the
          maintainers of the project are only providing security updates. No new
          features will be added. See
          <a href="https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/discussions/4906"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note: you should always follow the
          <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/"
            >3-2-1</a
          >
          backup plan for any photos or files.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Syncthing</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing">Syncthing</a> is an
        application that allows for peer-to-peer file synchronization. Using
        Syncthing along with a file server can replace the need for services
        like iCloud. I use Syncthing to sync my screenshots and download folders
        between my phone and computer and back up photos from phone to my
        server. Syncthing relies on a discovery server to find peers. You can
        self-host the discovery server, but the Syncthing project also maintains
        a public global discovery cluster.
      </p>
      <h3>Immich</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/immich-app/immich">Immich</a> is a popular
        application that aims to replace Google Photos. It allows you to upload
        photos, create albums, search photos, face recognition, and other
        features found in Google Photos.
      </p>
      <p>
        This software allows you to easily view photos on your server and also
        backup photos from your phone. Currently, I use this application to view
        photos from my DSLR camera which I store on my server, and my dad uses
        this to back up the photos on his phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a demo instance here:
        <a href="https://demo.immich.app/">https://demo.immich.app/</a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Note: you should always follow the
          <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/"
            >3-2-1</a
          >
          backup plan for any photos or files.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Vaultwarden</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a> is
        "an alternative server implementation of the Bitwarden Client API,
        written in Rust and compatible with official Bitwarden clients." This
        means you can use the official Bitwarden app and browser extensions with
        your self hosted Vaultwarden service.
      </p>
      <h3>WireGuard</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is a VPN protocol
        that can be used to connect to your home's LAN. This is useful if you do
        not want to expose your applications to the internet but want to access
        your services away from home. You can use
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">wireguard-tools</a> or
        other WireGuard implementations such as
        <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn">PiVPN</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Note: PiVPN is maintained on a best-effort basis. See
          <a href="https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/releases/tag/v4.6.1">here</a>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Minecraft Server</h3>
      <p>
        Open source software is not the only thing you can self host. You can
        also host game servers such as Minecraft, Factorio, or Terraria. There
        are many guides on self hosting via CLI or you can use a game server
        management software like
        <a href="https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel">Pterodactyl</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Self hosting is a fun way to improve your privacy and save money. It
        also provides additional life to your old computers and a playground to
        become familiar with Linux. You can self host software alternatives to
        Google services or other helpful services. I recommend anyone interested
        in technology and tinkering with Linux to give self hosting a try.
