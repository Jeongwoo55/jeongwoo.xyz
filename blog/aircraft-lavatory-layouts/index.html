      <h1>The unique layouts of airplane cargo hold lavatories</h1>
      <p6>Posted on <time datetime="2025-11-22">2025-11-22</time></p6>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        In (belated) recognition of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Toilet_Day"
          >World Toilet Day</a
        >, this blog post is going to talk about aircraft layouts with
        interesting lavatory placements.
      </p>
      <h2>Lufthansa's A340-600 Layout</h2>
      <p>
        When you walk to the rear of Lufthansa's Airbus A340-600, you will
        notice there are no lavatories. Instead, they have been installed in the
        cargo hold of the aircraft.
      </p>
      <img
        src="Lufthansa-A340-600-layout.png"

      />
      <p>
        This is because the A340-600 variant has a lot of cargo space, 201.7
        cubic meters. In comparison to the A340-500, the 600 variant has 50
        cubic meters more space. Lufthansa sought to better utilize the extra
        cargo space, so they moved the lavatories below the main deck and
        installed more seats. They also installed an extra galley and an
        elevator to move the food cart between decks.
      </p>
      <img
        src="Lufthansa-A340-600-staircase.jpg"
        alt="Lufthansa A340-600 staircase"
      />
      <p>
        An interesting quirk of this layout is that some passengers must wait on
        the main deck since the downstairs space only has 10 oxygen masks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar layout can be seen on Airtours/Thomas Cook's A330-200s. While
        these are smaller aircraft than the A340s, Airtours had a similar cargo
        problem to Lufthansa. As a tour operator, there is less need for cargo
        capacity, so they decided to install the lavatories in the cargo hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Thomas Cook went bankrupt in 2019 and the A330-200s were

          >2021</a
        >. However, Lufthansa has brought back the A340-600s after the pandemic
        due to passenger demand. There are

        flying for Lufthansa today. In the current era, the world is more
        reliant on express cargo delivery than ever before. In most cases, it is
        more valuable to fill the cargo space with actual cargo than relocating
        the lavatories. This is why airlines have not introduced this type of
        layout on modern aircraft.
      </p>
      <h2>Lockheed L-1011 Layout</h2>
      <p>
        The unique layouts on the A330s and A340s were built 20-25 years ago,
        but there was another aircraft built 25 years prior that also had a
        layout with interesting usage of the cargo space.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the 1970s, Pacific Southwest Airlines was facing capacity issues
        between San Francisco and Los Angeles. They decided to purchase
        Lockheed's L-1011 TriStar jet. This aircraft was a widebody and had too
        much cargo capacity for a short route, so PSA decided to install a
        lounge to the front of the aircraft. Passengers could enter the lounge
        from the main deck using an internal staircase or from the apron via the
        air stairs.
      </p>
      <img src="TriStar-lounge-interior.jpg" alt="TriStar lounge interior" />
      <p>
        While PSA's lounge was unique to their TriStar, the L-1011 also had a
        unique lavatory layout at the back of the aircraft. Known as "Cannery
        Row" by the crew, the TriStar had 5 lavatories at the back of the
        aircraft in a semicircle. Since the aircraft only had 7 lavatories
        total, this area could get busy during the flight. Another unique
        feature of the L-1011 is the galley placement. Similar to Lufthansa's
        layout, there was a galley in the cargo hold on the TriStar where crew
        could prepare food.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the oil crisis in 1973, PSA had to withdraw both TriStar jets
        after only 8 months of service. It is unlikely that we will see a layout
        similar to the TriStar in the future. The modern equivalent of PSA's
        lounge would be the lounges found on Airbus A380s. Notably Emirates,
        Qatar, Etihad, Korean Air, and Asiana have lounges on their superjumbo
        jets. However, many airlines are retiring these aircraft in favor of
        more efficient, twin-engine aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, cargo space has become extremely valuable due to global
        supply chains and international commerce, so it is highly unlikely we
        will see cargo holds turn into passenger spaces in the future.
