## Intro

In (belated) recognition of [World Toilet Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Toilet_Day), this blog post is going to talk about aircraft layouts with interesting lavatory placements.

## Lufthansa's A340-600 Layout

When you walk to the rear of Lufthansa's Airbus A340-600, you will notice there are no lavatories. Instead, they have been installed in the cargo hold of the aircraft.

This is because the A340-600 variant has a lot of cargo space, 201.7 cubic meters. In comparison to the A340-500, the 600 variant has 50 cubic meters more space. Lufthansa sought to better utilize the extra cargo space, so they moved the lavatories below the main deck and installed more seats. They also installed an extra galley and an elevator to move the food cart between decks.

An interesting quirk of this layout is that some passengers must wait on the main deck since the downstairs space only has 10 oxygen masks.

A similar layout can be seen on Airtours/Thomas Cook's A330-200s. While these are smaller aircraft than the A340s, Airtours had a similar cargo problem to Lufthansa. As a tour operator, there is less need for cargo capacity, so they decided to install the lavatories in the cargo hold.

Unfortunately, Thomas Cook went bankrupt in 2019 and the A330-200s were [disassembled](https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/airbus-a330-200-g-mdbd-thomas-cook-airlines/e9jdqr) [in](https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/airbus-a330-200-g-omyt-thomas-cook-airlines/eg97l3) [2021](https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/airbus-a330-200-g-mljl-thomas-cook-airlines/38qpl3). However, Lufthansa has brought back the A340-600s after the pandemic due to passenger demand. There are [6 active A340-600s](https://www.planespotters.net/airline/Lufthansa) flying for Lufthansa today. In the current era, the world is more reliant on express cargo delivery than ever before. In most cases, it is more valuable to fill the cargo space with actual cargo than relocating the lavatories. This is why airlines have not introduced this type of layout on modern aircraft.

## Lockheed L-1011 Layout

The unique layouts on the A330s and A340s were built 20-25 years ago, but there was another aircraft built 25 years prior that also had a layout with interesting usage of the cargo space.

In the 1970s, Pacific Southwest Airlines was facing capacity issues between San Francisco and Los Angeles. They decided to purchase Lockheed's L-1011 TriStar jet. This aircraft was a widebody and had too much cargo capacity for a short route, so PSA decided to install a lounge to the front of the aircraft. Passengers could enter the lounge from the main deck using an internal staircase or from the apron via the air stairs.

While PSA's lounge was unique to their TriStar, the L-1011 also had a unique lavatory layout at the back of the aircraft. Known as "Cannery Row" by the crew, the TriStar had 5 lavatories at the back of the aircraft in a semicircle. Since the aircraft only had 7 lavatories total, this area could get busy during the flight. Another unique feature of the L-1011 is the galley placement. Similar to Lufthansa's layout, there was a galley in the cargo hold on the TriStar where crew could prepare food.

## Conclusion

Due to the oil crisis in 1973, PSA had to withdraw both TriStar jets after only 8 months of service. It is unlikely that we will see a layout similar to the TriStar in the future. The modern equivalent of PSA's lounge would be the lounges found on Airbus A380s. Notably Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean Air, and Asiana have lounges on their superjumbo jets. However, many airlines are retiring these aircraft in favor of more efficient, twin-engine aircraft.

Additionally, cargo space has become extremely valuable due to global supply chains and international commerce, so it is highly unlikely we will see cargo holds turn into passenger spaces in the future.
