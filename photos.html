      <p>
        This is a place for me to share my photos and my journey as a noice
        photographer. Currently, I use a <em>Nikon D3500</em> with its kit
        lenses for most of my photos. Occasionally, I may borrow a lens from a
        friend for a few photos. My interest in types of photography ranges
        widely and I'm always willing to experiment! Most of my photos are taken
        while traveling but I have recently started exploring my local area for
        photographic scenes.
