                This is a place for me to share my photos and my journey as a noice photographer. Currently, I use a <em>Nikon D3500</em> with its kit lenses for most of my photos.
                Occasionally, I may borrow a lens from a friend for a few photos. My interest in types of photography ranges widely and I'm always willing to experiment!
                Most of my photos are taken while traveling but I have recently started exploring my local area for photographic scenes.
